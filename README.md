Simple python scripts for SEOs

[1. Categorize Search Intention in bulk using semrush + pandas](https://github.com/cscholles/SEO/blob/master/Categorize_search_intention_in_bulk_using_semrush_and_pandas.ipynb)

[2. My cookbook: small python scripts for SEOs (to avoid excel)](https://github.com/cscholles/SEO/blob/master/Cookbook_Small_scripts_for_SEOs_to_avoid_excel.ipynb)
Started my own python and pandas cookbook, focused on SEO data analysis without excel. The idea is to register useful scripts that I use with more frequency in my daily activies.
